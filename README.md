# Embedding General Metrics into $l_p$-Spaces

This repo contains an implementation of the embedding suggested in "Advances in metric embedding theory" by I. Abraham, Y. Bartal, O. Neiman:

Given any finite metric space X of size $n$ and $p \geq 1$, there is an embedding $f: X \to \ell_p^(O(\log n))$ such that: 1. all the pairwise distances are preserved up to a multiplicative factor $O(log n)$, 2. the average distance error, denoted $\ell_q$-distortion, is bounded by $O(q)$ for any $q\geq 1$.
